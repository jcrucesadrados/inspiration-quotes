# About this repository
This is a learning repository that is intended to be a source for a Laravel Package.

The package has been developed following the instructions of the following article: https://adevait.com/laravel/how-to-create-a-custom-package-for-laravel

By the way, after the first implementation, I have added some goods like:
* Follow a SOLID Architecture
* Add tests compatible with a Laravel Package (using [Orchestral Testbench](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench))
* Setup GitHub actions to test the repository before merging the code to master
